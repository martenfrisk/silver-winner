# MyanLingo — Ideas & Roadmap

Backlog of improvements and next steps, roughly ordered by expected impact within
each group. Everything fits the localStorage-only, no-backend setup.

Legend: ✅ = implemented · 💤 = backlog

## Highest impact next

1. ✅ **Listening-only exercise type** — the audio pipeline exists but is never the
   *question*. "What did you hear?" (play MP3 → pick the script/meaning) is
   Duolingo's bread-and-butter and we have hundreds of clips ready to drive it.
2. ✅ **Course-side spaced repetition** — SRS currently only covers glyphs.
   Vocabulary from completed lessons should feed a "Practice" button on the home
   path (reuse the Leitner logic in `srs.svelte.ts`), so finished lessons don't go
   stale and there's a daily reason to return after finishing the path.
3. ✅ **More course content** — 4 units is thin. Natural next units: Family,
   Places/Directions, Shopping & money (pairs well with the digits unit), Time &
   days, and a first verbs/sentence-patterns unit. Pure content work.
4. ✅ **Mistake review** — persist recently-missed items and offer a "fix your
   mistakes" session, built on the existing requeue mechanism.
5. ✅ **Daily goal + calendar** — a settable XP goal with a progress ring on home,
   and a month-view activity heatmap on the profile page. The streak exists but
   has no visible "today" target, which is the actual habit hook.

## Script Studio deepening

6. 💤 **Handwriting practice — rebuild the tracing pad** (supersedes
   "stroke-order guidance"). **The whole pad is currently gated off**
   (`TRACING_ENABLED` in `src/lib/script-session.ts`), so no `trace` exercise
   reaches either queue. Two separate defects sank it:
   - *Grading was fake.* Completion was a pixel-coverage ratio — paint over
     ~50% of the glyph's cells and it passed. That can't distinguish writing
     the letter from scribbling across its area, so it cut the exercise off
     mid-letter and passed everyone (which also made #10's SRS grade
     meaningless).
   - *Stroke hints were misaligned.* The paths in `strokeData`
     (`src/lib/data/script.ts`) were authored against an HTML text rendering,
     but the pad paints its glyph with canvas `fillText`, so they landed at
     the wrong scale (~70px of stroke over a ~96px glyph). Separately gated by
     `STROKE_HINTS_ENABLED` in `TraceExercise.svelte`.

   All the code and data are kept. A real rebuild needs per-stroke path
   comparison (direction, order, start point) against authored strokes rather
   than a coverage ratio, and stroke paths derived from the pad's own
   `fillText` metrics.
7. ✅ **Minimal-pair listening drills** — aspirated vs. unaspirated (က/ခ, စ/ဆ,
   တ/ထ) and tone contrasts (မ/မာ/မား). These distinctions are *the* hard part of
   Burmese phonology and the syllable audio set already contains the pairs.
8. ✅ **Decodable sentences** — once a learner knows ~30 glyphs, short real
   sentences (not just words) as a reading "graduation" exercise per unit.
9. ✅ **Stacked consonants (ပါဌ်ဆင့်)** — currently unaddressed; even one intro
   unit makes real-world text much less alien.
10. 💤 **Write-from-memory mode** — tracing with the template hidden (tap to
    peek), as the top SRS box exercise for consonants. *Built once and
    disabled* along with the rest of the tracing pad (see the note under #6):
    its SRS grade was only as good as the pad's pass/fail, which any scribble
    satisfied.

## Gamification & retention

11. ✅ **Achievements** — "First 10 glyphs", "7-day streak", "Perfect lesson ×5",
    "Read your first word"… shown on the profile page.
12. ✅ **Crown levels / lesson leveling** — redo a completed lesson at a harder
    tier (no hints, romanization forced off, timed).
13. ✅ **Streak freeze** — earnable with XP; makes the streak feel ownable rather
    than fragile.
14. ✅ **Combo meter in lessons** — consecutive correct answers give a small XP
    multiplier with escalating SFX.

## UX & polish

15. ✅ **Keyboard shortcuts everywhere** — 1–4 to pick options, Enter to continue,
    in both the course player and Script Studio.
16. ✅ **Dark mode** — the design tokens in `app.css` make this mostly a
    variable swap; the cream/gold palette needs a deliberate dark counterpart.
17. ✅ **PWA / offline** — service worker caching the audio and app shell. Still
    local; makes the phone-home-screen use case work.
18. 💤 **Voice option in settings** — offer the male voice
    (`my-MM-ThihaNeural`) alongside the female one; volume sliders for SFX vs.
    speech.
19. 💤 **Accessibility pass** — focus management when exercises swap, `aria-live`
    verdict announcements, discoverable trace-skip path.
20. 💤 **Progress export/import** — download/restore a JSON backup of the
    localStorage keys from the profile page.

## Engineering quality

21. ✅ **Unit tests** — `buildSyllable`, SRS scheduling math, and the drill-queue
    generators are pure functions begging for `bun test`.
22. ✅ **Content lint script** — `bun run lint:content`: every exercise's answer
    is among its options, every confusable ID exists, every speakable string has
    an MP3 in the manifest.
23. ✅ **Playwright smoke test** — script a lesson start-to-finish so future
    refactors get caught.
24. 💤 **Native-speaker content audit** — generated syllable romanizations, a few
    mnemonics, and tone representation (creaky/low/high) deserve a human pass.
